In this part of the assignment, unit test cases for circular buffer and the doubly linked list has been written. I have written many test cases using the cmocka APIs to the modules

There are 13 test cases for circular buffer
    Test cases such as: 
        Circular Buffer initialization
        Adding elements into the bufer
        Removing element from the buffer
        Destroying the buffer
        Check if the buffer is full/empty/null
        Wrap add/remove
        Over fill and over empty
        Size of the circular buffer

There are 21 test cases for double linked list
    Test cases such as:
        Adding a node at the head,last, in between, in empty list and adding at an invalid location
        Removing a node at the head, last, in between, empty list, and removing from invalid location 
        Searching a node at the head, last, in between, empty list, and from invalid location 
        Destroying a valid linked list and an empty linked list
        Test case for determining the size of the linked list
